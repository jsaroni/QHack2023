# QHack2023_Feynmanprodigies


Finding the ground state of large molecules is a core problem in quantum chemistry and physics. In this project, we will compare the performance of different methodologies for finding the ground state of the molecule BeH2. We will use circuit cutting and knitting technique, to implement an algorithm which uses classical methods to augment the computation. This will involve an encoding and feedback during, before, and after training.  We will implement small scale error correction on qubits with highest error rates to control the quantum volume and Qiskit Runtime error mitigation. We will tackle the barren plateau problems through AdaptVQE.


The custom ansatz files shows that a better ground state is approximated for the example of a Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice as in the 2023 IBM open science prize.
